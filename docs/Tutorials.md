# 0. Overview<a name="overview"></a>
The computer that this project runs on is a Raspberry Pi Zero. It uses a cheap Logitech Webcam to live stream video of the aquarium (using [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome)). The RPi is also connected to a [4 channel relay](https://www.amazon.com/SainSmart-101-70-101-4-Channel-Relay-Module/dp/B0057OC5O8/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1512765893&sr=8-4&keywords=4+channel+relay) that powers 4 outlets, individually. This page will cover the tutorials necessary to start with a collection of parts to finishing with a completed build with the project installed.
