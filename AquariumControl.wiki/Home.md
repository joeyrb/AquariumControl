Below is an outline of what this page is planned to contain (for now)

# Project Description
* introduction to the goal of the project
* brief description of the different parts of the project and what problems they solve

# Introduction to Aquariums
* Basic equipment
* Aspects to consider 
* Common misconceptions ("fish grow to the size of the tank")

# Common Problems
* Survey results so far
* Algae, light cycle, beginner setup, water testing, "nanny" mode
* No centralized place for researching aquarium inhabitant requirements
* Getting started is overwhelming ("wtf is the nitrogen cycle?", "You're supposed to change the water?")
* comparing parameters with other users or with past measurements
* checking compatibility with your tank or the tank you have in mind
* tracking changes in water quality
* expensive products currently on the market (timers, not actually automated)
* Inspiration to create this project (include pics from aftermath of shitty auto-feeder)
# Solution
* User stories
* Broken down by: feature or solution to problem?
* Automated aspects
* Centralized place for searching plants/animals
* View your profile and share with others (useful for posting to forums about a problem)
* R&D
